This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `useLocation` hook in React Router v6 within nested components. The bug showcases how the location object may not update correctly, leading to stale data in the UI. The solution provides a method to resolve this using the `useEffect` hook and dependency array to ensure updates reflect the current route changes.
